Since the extension has started to evolve beyond the original video chat platform (due to the near-zero complexity of adapting to new platforms and the huge under-reached audience), I want to clarify some basic points about development independence and neutrality:
1. This extension will never be sold to third parties and will never be monetized by the malicious methods.  
2. This extension will never interfere with the functionality that is critical for the functioning of video chats: it will not oppose the moderation, user identification and ban systems, as well as implement functionality similar to the paid functions of video chat platforms (for example, if video chat offers a gender filter for money - I don't implement the same in the extension and so on, there may be exceptions, such as: geolocation, adblock, bot filter, etc.).
3. This extension will never partner with any video chats to promote them to the extension's audience. Video chat platforms in the list of supported ones are listed in the order of appearance of this very support.
4. I don't plan to create my own video chat and use my extension to promote it: I have my main project (unrelated to video chats), which takes most of my life energy, and I'm not going to cheat on it.
5. This extension and all its software components will always be distributed under free and open-source licenses.

If I ever need money to support my work, I will create Patreon/Boosty pages to provide it at the expense of interested users. The previous five points can be considered the constitution of the extension with all the consequences.  

It severely limits the opportunities for monetization, but I believe this is the only way to develop the extension while avoiding conflicts of interest with supported video chats.
